- W3C CSS Validation Service [CSS Result]
Accessibility was checked at [www.webaccessibility.com]
Responsiveness was checked thought using the Google dev tools and [www.responsinator.com]

A code review was posted in the Code Institute peer-code-review channel.

This was recorded in [functional-testing.xlsx](functional-testing.xlsx). Another tab was added after user testing to regression test functionality following changes through the user testing feedback.
