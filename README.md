## Testing

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section


Both HTML and CSS have been validated via

- W3C [Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
- W3C CSS Validation Service [CSS Result]
Accessibility was checked at [www.webaccessibility.com]
Responsiveness was checked thought using the Google dev tools and [www.responsinator.com]

A code review was posted in the Code Institute peer-code-review channel.


Functional testing was carried out against every element to ensure everything worked and was linked as expected before user tested was started. This was recorded in [functional-testing.xlsx](functional-testing.xlsx). Another tab was added after user testing to regression test functionality following changes through the user testing feedback.
