## Testing

Python code was tested for PEP8 compliancy with no issues http://pep8online.com
HTML was tested though https://validator.w3.org/ by copying and pasting in the page source for each page. This raised on error that I've accepted.
Accepted error:
<img src="static/images/accepted-error.png" style="margin: 0;">
Each error is generated from a select element that does have a unique id. Therefore it is not a muliple selection is a single selection element.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

A code review was posted in the Code Institute peer-code-review channel.



Functional testing was carried out against every element to ensure everything worked and was linked as expected before user tested was started. This was recorded in [functional-testing.xlsx](functional-testing.xlsx). Another tab was added after user testing to regression test functionality following changes through the user testing feedback.
